			After completing a bachelors of applied science in electrical engineering from Queen's in 2004, he emigrated to Sydney, Australia to design cell phone base stations for the mobile carrier Optus. Finding the human element lacking in engineering, Greg Matthew returned to Canada in 2006 to pursue a bachelors of design in industrial design. Since graduating from OCADU in 2010, he has worked as a furniture designer, an invention consultant and a package and merchandising designer for a tool reseller in Toronto.

			Greg Matthew is also the cofounder of Checklick, a web application that helps sport coaches track their athletesâ€™ training progress using mobile devices. By replacing paper with software, Checklick also provides national sport organizations with a new source of data. Checklick interprets this data into metrics and insights, which helps sport organizations make better decisions.
